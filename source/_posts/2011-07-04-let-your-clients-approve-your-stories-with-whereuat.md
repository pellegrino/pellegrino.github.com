Yesterday i've been playing with this project called [whereuat](https://github.com/plus2/whereuat). This project is a very neat idea which enables your users to give feedback, approve and reject  stories marked as delivered directly at your pivotal tracker.

The application is pretty simple by itself. Its basically a scaffold for recipes, with whereuat integration.

For anyone working in a situation where clients or even QA are required to participate more closely at the development process, i would recommend it to give whereuat a look.


## Check the examples
