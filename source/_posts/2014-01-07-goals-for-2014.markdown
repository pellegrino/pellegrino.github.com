Keeping the same idea of the previous year, I've decided to commit myself to no more than 3 different goals for this year. The reason for this is to maintain focus and not sign me up for more things that I'm able/willing to do each time.

Things that I will be doing this year:

## Weigh 90kg or more with 10%BF or less by my 30th birthday.

Before my 30th birthday I will be achieving my always wanted physique. I want to celebrate my 30th birthday enjoying my best phisique so far.

Milestones:

* April 18th: Weigh 90kg with less than 20%BF
* September 15th: Weigh 90kg averaging 13%BF
* November 17th: Weigh 90~95kg with 10%BF at most

## 5 German writing exercises every week.

I consider this one to be pretty self-explanatory: I will be doing german writing exercises at least 5 times each week in order to improve my (very poor) written german and acquire overall fluency.

As a "side-goal" of this one, I will tentatively obtain the C1 pr√ºfung by late may, early june. These exercises will be published and documented so I can see the overall improvement with

## Will write a technical blogpost every month this year.

At the beginning of the month, I will elect a topic and spend the month researching about it and produce a blog post in vitorpellegrino.com with the results of it.
