Blogging and open-source are two things i've always wanted to do more
seriously but never knew how to get started. After
[RMU](http://university.rubymendicant.com) (BTW, if you are serious
about mastering Ruby and OSS development, THIS is the place) i felt i
needed a whole refresh at this space.

Since i'm most of my day at Emacs and [Github](http://github.com),
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) was perfect fit for my
current setup. I hope it works for me.
